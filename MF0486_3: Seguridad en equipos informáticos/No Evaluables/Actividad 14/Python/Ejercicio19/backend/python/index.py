# This code snippet is creating a list called `lista` with the elements "Di", "buen", "día", "a", and
# "Jorge". Then, it is using slicing with `[::-1]` to reverse the order of the elements in the list.
# Finally, it prints the reversed list.

lista = ["Di", "buen", "día", "a", "Jorge"];
print(lista[::-1]);
